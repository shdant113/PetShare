## User Stories

### Upon visiting the site:
1. The user is prompted to log in. If they do not have an account, they can click the "register" button, which will direct them to a registration form. Upon successful submission of either form, they will be logged into the site.
2. The user is required to have a username and password in order to log in. In order to register, a user will be required to have a username, password, email, prefered display name, and location. They will be able to add a user bio later on their profile.

### Once logged in:
1. If the user owns a pet, they can create a pet. The user will be prompted to enter the pet's name, type (i.e. cat, dog, etc.) and age as well as any special requirements their pet has for pet sitting. The database will automatically store when the pet was created and assign the user as the owner of the pet.  
2. The user can see posts of each available pet sitting session. If they have registered a pet, they will also be able to add their own posts to find a pet sitter.
3. The user can also visit their own profile, which will allow them to update their bio and see all of their information.

### Posts:
1. Each post will be related to a user whose username (or display name) will be displayed with their post. Users can visit the profiles of the people that made each post and also press a the "I can help!" button, indicating that they are available to pet sit. When the button is pressed, the user that created the post will be able to either accept or decline. If they accept, the post disappears from the page and its contents are added to the current schedule of both the sitter and the owner.

### Notifications:
1. When a sitter is requesting acceptance on a post, the poster will receive a badge notification in the header. The notification will disappear only when action is taken on it. 

### Stretch goals:
1. Image uploading --> a site with pets is not complete without pictures of said pets, and having head shots of the person you're asking to sit for you might be good for peace of mind.
2. Location services --> ensuring the accuracy of the location that people sign up with and use, plus allowing us to filter the posts that people see based on their location.
3. Payment services --> to begin with, there will be no payments made on the site.
4. Email notifications --> each badge notification prompts an automatic email, and sitters and owners can communicate with each other directly by email prior to meeting or accepting a job.
