## Navigating PetShare

Upon visiting the site, the user is prompted to log in. If the user does not have an account, they can register. Upon successful validation of either their registration or login, they will automatically be logged into the site. 

Users can sign up with a username and email but their display name will be most prominent on the site. Display names are featured on their profile, in each of their posts, and in their interactions with other users. Users can message each other by accessing one another's profiles or simply using the link provided in each post, enabling users to inquire about available pet sitting opportunities and make appropriate arrangements.

In order to create a post, the user must first register a pet. Once they provide the necessary information about their pet, the user can create their post and expect messages from other members shortly. At their convenience, they can log back in and will receive a notification on their dashboard if they have unread messages from other users. Once those messages are read, the notification will no longer appear, but the messages will be available in their message inbox unless the user chooses to delete them or the sender deletes their account on PetShare.

Users can see posts from any location but are encouraged to message only users in their immediate area.

Users can update their bio as well as edit information about their pets from their profile. They can also erase their account if they choose from their profile.
